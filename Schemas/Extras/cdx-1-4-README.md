Current state of work-in-progress JADN schema based on the [CDX v1.4 JSON schema](https://github.com/CycloneDX/specification/blob/master/schema/bom-1.4.schema.json).

## Created by: 
David Lemire (HII Mission Technologies)

## Status:

 1) Complete JADN capture from the CDX JSON schema
 2) Has not been tested against any CDX SBOMs
 3) Required / optional values still needed for most record types
 4) May contain duplicative types
 5) Would benefit from re-ordering content more logically
